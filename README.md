qmk_installer: An Windows Driver Installation library for QMK supported USB devices
===================================================================================
Based on libwdi. The library is in fact a fork of libwdi, but adds some new executables and configuration files for QMK supported devices.

It can be compiled by Visual Studio 2017, read the [libwdi instructions](https://github.com/pbatard/libwdi/wiki/Compiling-and-debugging-libwdi-or-Zadig) for further details.

By default it installs drivers only for connected devices, which need to be in bootloader(flashing) mode. If you specify the --all option it will install drivers for unconnected devices too. It doesn't override any existing drivers, but that can be forced by the --force option.

**Usage:**
```
qmk_installer [--force] [--all] drivers_list
--force         forces installation over existing drivers
--all           installs drivers for unconnected devices
--help          displays this message
drivers_list    path to a file with a list of drivers to install
```

The drivers_list is a file with the following format
```
# The format is
# driver,desc,vid,pid,guid
# Use a comma as a separator without spaces
# Driver can be one of winusb,libusb,libusbk
# Use Windows Powershell and type [guid]::NewGuid() to generate guids
